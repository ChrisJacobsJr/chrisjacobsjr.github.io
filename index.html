    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    
    <p>
        Check out my github projects below... Or that's what I'd like to say, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">but this site isn't done yet</span>.
        If you're a recruiter, or were linked here from my resume, <span style="color: pink; font-weight: bold">pretty</span> please check the site out on September 13, 2024.

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <p>
        This website. One of my professors mentioned
        a recent trend in web design based on how web pages looked in the 90s.
        Until recently, I thought he just meant that the sites didn't use CSS, but I found
        an community of hackers and open source enthusiasts who have blogs and mastodons and stuff, 
        and they were using the theme. It makes you think about all of the cool people many are missing out on because we only
        talk on mainstream social media. Anyways, I think the style is cool, and plan on implementing it.

        I'm working on a Python script that will sync some files for Call of Duty Black Ops III (No affiliation)
        so that I can use "Boiii client," referencing Ainsley Harriott's viral cooking show. He's pictured below.

        Last, I am completing a handful of simple projects (for example, a gui calculator, or a file server) to demonstrate
        proficiency in a variety of languages and software. I don't like buzzwords, cancel me I don't care. ðŸ¤ª

    <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
    <p>
        I've transferred some repositories from my school account onto this one, so you can check those out. Any more I create will be linked here.
        I have saved some of my school projects that are worth posting on my github, so they'll be listed here too, when I get around to uploading them, which is soon.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hmm, do I write an About Me section that shows employers how unique and interesting I am , (I'm uhh so cool and handsome ðŸ˜€) or do I write a section
        that shows how professional and corporate I am? You should email me your thoughts. You will email me your thoughts. Please?
