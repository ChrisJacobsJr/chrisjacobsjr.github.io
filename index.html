        <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This site isn't done yet</span>.
        Soon I will have a link to past projects/schoolwork. Currently planning the site layout.

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>

            <p>
                This website. I'm thinking about implementing the cool 90's web style that's aparently popular among cybersecurity enthusiasts.

            <p>
                I'm working on a Python script that will sync some map files for Call of Duty Black Ops III Zombies (BOIII)
                so that I can use "Boiii client," whose title is referencing Ainsley Harriott's viral cooking show. He's pictured below.
                I play on the Boiii client, because the game is aging and there have been remote code execution exploits
                uncovered. Just having the game open around the time a hacker is active is enough to have arbitrary code
                running on your system.

        Last, I am completing a handful of simple projects (for example, a gui calculator, or a file server) to demonstrate
        proficiency in a variety of languages and software. 🤪

    <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
    <p>
        I have some in my GitHub from school, but I also have four years of coding assignments that
        will be uploaded soon.

    <h3>Quick Bio</h3>
    <p>
        Like many programming enthusiasts, I was exposed to computers when I was four years old. 
        I found them (and math/science in general) very interesting and would figure the ins
        and outs of any digital device handed to me. Coding didn't start until middle school, however.
        In high school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a living. If not for computer science, I
        would have pursued a career in human resources. So, I got a Comp-Sci degree.
