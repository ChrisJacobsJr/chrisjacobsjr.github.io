                <a href="https://github.com/ChrisJacobsJr/UsermapsMover">UserMapsMover (GitHub)</a>
                 - Python program with GUI that moves and manipulates files. It is for users playing on a custom version
                 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Zombies, which is unable to access custom maps downloaded from Steam
                 because they are in the wrong format. This program offers a simple GUI that can move the folders to
                 the correct directory, manipulate their data so they can be used by the boiii client, and display some
                 information relevant to the user.

    <h3>WHO am I?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Christopher. I'm logical, pragmatic, and extroverted. My hobbies include reading,
        outdoorsey stuff, and art. Also, programming (its fun) and gaming. I like skill
        games, such as first person shooters and fighting games, but I also enjoy games with
        systems, like Magic: The Gathering. I'm funny, spontaneous, and consider myself well
        adjusted. In a true colors personality test (Green Blue Orange Gold), my two colors
        were orange and gold, with some green.

    <h3>Why Comp Sci?</h3>
    <p>
        Like many programming enthusiasts, I was exposed to computers when I was four years old. 
        I found them (and math/science in general) very interesting and would figure the ins
        and outs of any digital device handed to me. Coding didn't start until middle school, however.
        In high school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a living. If not for computer science, I
        would have pursued a career in human resources. So, I got a Comp-Sci degree.
